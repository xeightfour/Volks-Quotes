We gonna prove once and for all that all these people talking bout a East Coast West Coast war they like the Judas was to Jesus.\
They only here to cause confusion. We here to bring money and to bring change. They here to bring confusion.\
All these weak rappers Nas and all these suckaz they battling off East and West like it's a game. This ain't no game.\
If this was chess, we'd be yelling checkmate three muthafuckin' years ago. Cuz we been beat these muthafuckaz.

Mr., Makaveli movin' pieces like telekinesis\
It's like a chess game, let's play wit' real pieces

- PAC's hologram is more real than most rappers today.

Hey mister prankster, prankster, story book gangsta\
Back in '86 you wore the pumps and mascara\
Down with the motherfuckin' Wreckin' Cru, bitch\
But once a bitch is always a bitch and now the fuckin' switch\
Fag, with stethescope now you sag\
Body slammin' bitches makes a Dre a bigger man

Smoke a lil' sherm, now you call that shit the chronic\
Niggas on the westside call it bionic\
I make a mil' here, make a mil' there\
Fuck a bitch here, fuck a bitch there, yeah

To the man - the late, great, often imitated, but never duplicated **Eazy motherfuckin E**
